This was the challenge , so I did copy "4bd939ed2e01ed1e8540ed137763d73cd8590323" and put it to "https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash"
and got the hash decrypted as "zwischen" which is the password to the file "crack2.7z"

Now I opened the archive with the password and there after I got many folders inside folders whose names actually ended up as the flag of the challenge.
